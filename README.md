This is a demonstration project using Google Maps JavaScript API and Google Places API.
It uses the API's to generate a map of Portland's Old Port centered on the restaurant Street and Company.
It places custom markes to indicate nearby restaurants in the second tier prirce range.
Users enter a text search to find additional Portland restaurants by name or keyword.
A pin drops on the marker associated with the restaurant that most closely matches the search term.
The map recenters around that location.
Hovering over the markers or the red pin reveals the restaurant's name as the marker's label.
Clicking on the marker or pin reveals the street address as an Info Window.
